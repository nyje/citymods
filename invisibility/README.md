Invisibility Potion by TenPlus1

This mod lets you craft an invisibility potion using 1x Nyan Cat Rainbow and 1x Glass Bottle.

Use potion to hide yourself AND nametag (0.4.14 dev only) for 5 minutes.

Server admin can use the '/vanish <name>' command to hide/unhide players or themselves by leaving it blank.
